#TL;DR: 
##My Email: chris@kareer.me 
##Coupon code plz. 
<br>

###Jeff I hit you up on twitter, and you had agreed to a coupon code for this awesome book which I am reading. 
<br>
### My presentation is tonight, and I have around 30 - 35 RSVP's. I the icing would really be awesome to give coupons from the power houses in the PHP community (Yourself, Taylor, Dayle, etc. if there were more )
<br>
###Anyway, I tried again on twitter to contact you after you agreed, but I had no response, being the tenatious fellow that I am, I figured this may git your attention? 
<br>

Very Respectfully,
